    "The k-means algorithm does not directly work with cosine distance, so we take an alternative route to remove length information: we normalize all vectors to be unit length. It turns out that Euclidean distance closely mimics cosine distance when all vectors are unit length. In particular, the squared Euclidean distance between any two vectors of length one is directly proportional to their cosine distance. This tells us that two unit vectors that are close in Euclidean distance are also close in cosine distance. Thus, the k-means algorithm (which naturally uses Euclidean distances) on normalized vectors will produce the same results as clustering using cosine distance as a distance metric."

    "That said, the result for K=100 is not entirely bad. After all, it gives us separate clusters for such categories as Brazil, wrestling, computer science and the Mormon Church. If we set K somewhere between 25 and 100, we should be able to avoid breaking up clusters while discovering new ones.\n",

    "Also, we should ask ourselves how much granularity we want in our clustering. If we wanted a rough sketch of Wikipedia, we don't want too detailed clusters. On the other hand, having many clusters can be valuable when we are zooming into a certain part of Wikipedia.\n",

    "Another heuristic people use that does not rely on so much visualization, which can be hard in many applications (including here!) is as follows. Track heterogeneity versus K and look for the \"elbow\" of the curve where the heterogeneity decrease rapidly before this value of K, but then only gradually for larger values of K. This naturally trades off between trying to minimize heterogeneity, but reduce model complexity. In the heterogeneity versus K plot made above, we did not yet really see a flattening out of the heterogeneity, which might indicate that indeed K=100 is \"reasonable\" and we only see real overfitting for larger values of K (which are even harder to visualize using the methods we attempted above.)"
